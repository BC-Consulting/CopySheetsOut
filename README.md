# Save all sheets in separate files

LibreOffice macro to save all the sheets from a spreadsheet in separate files. Filenames are automatically generated from sheets name.

Macro has the following customisation:

- Output format (xls, xlsx, ods or csv)
- Location of the output folder
- Output filename can be further customised

## Installation

Download "CopySheetOut.bas" to your computer, open the file in an editor and copy all its content to clipboard.

Open LibreOffice macro editor: Tools -> Macros -> Edit macros (note: macros must be enabled, this is not the default in LibreOffice!)

Expand: My Macros & Dialogs -> Standard -> Module1

Paste clipboard into Module1. "Sub CopySheetOut()" is created.

## How to use

1. Open the spreadsheet you want to copy sheets from

2. Open the macro editor

3. Scroll to the following section inside "Sub CopySheetOut()"

    <pre>
    ' - * - * - * - * - *
    'Start customisation
    </pre>

4. And change the following variables to fit your requirements:

    <pre>
      Full name of the folder to save the documents to.
      On Windows use / instead of \ to define the folder path.
      Terminate the path with /
         <font color="blue">root = "C:/Your/Output/folder/here/"
         loca = "another/sub-folder/"</font>
      We use a special naming convention: root/sheet_name/loca/sheet_name.extn
    
      The output name will be the sheet name with some changes
      An optional suffix for the filename
         <font color="blue">suff = ""</font>
    
      Output file format:
         <font color="blue">extn = 0</font>   -  0: .xls;  1: .xlsx;  3: .ods;   4: .csv
    </pre>

## Notes

Path separator is / not \ (even on Windows)!

To enabled macros: Tools -> Options... -> LibreOffice -> Security -> Macro Security... -> *select your security model to allow execution of macros (medium is good)*.

## CSV options:

To save in .csv takes an extra parameter: *FilterOptions*

An example is shown below with some options explained:

<pre>
args2(2).Value = "44,34,76,1,,0,false,true,false,false,false"
                   ^ ^  ^  ^  ^  ^     ^    ^    ^     ^-: ?
